"""Project Manager operation/interface layer.

This package sits between the HTTP API and the filesystem.
It is not a replacement for the Project Manager; it provides a
clean set of operations that multiple interfaces (browser, AI
agents, scripts) can use.

Every filesystem mutation eventually goes through
projectConfiguration.Project_files.
